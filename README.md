## 🎯 The Art of Documentation in the AI Era

Just as a skilled chef knows that the secret to a perfect paella lies in the quality of its ingredients and the order of preparation, PAELLADOC stems from a fundamental truth: **90% of success in AI programming depends on context**.

### 🧠 Why Context is Crucial?

- **AI is powerful, but needs direction**: Like an expert chef, it needs to know exactly what we want to achieve
- **Traditional documentation is scattered**: Like ingredients scattered in the kitchen
- **We waste time repeating context**: Like explaining the recipe over and over
- **Without proper context, we get generic answers**: Like a flavorless paella

### 🥘 The PAELLADOC Solution

Following the MECE principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), we organize documentation with a modular architecture:
