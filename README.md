## 🎯 The Art of Documentation in the AI Era

Just as a master chef knows that the secret to a perfect paella lies in the quality of its ingredients and the order of preparation, PAELLADOC builds on a fundamental truth: **90% of success in AI programming depends on context**.

### 🧠 Why Context is Crucial?

- **AI is powerful, but needs direction**: Like an expert chef, it needs to know exactly what we want to achieve
- **Traditional documentation is scattered**: Like ingredients scattered in the kitchen
- **We waste time repeating context**: Like explaining the recipe over and over
- **Without proper context, we get generic answers**: Like a flavorless paella

### 🥘 The PAELLADOC Solution

Following the MECE principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), we organize documentation with a modular architecture:

# PAELLADOC - Intelligent Documentation System

PAELLADOC is a documentation system that uses AI to analyze code repositories and generate comprehensive technical documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Access to terminal/command line

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paelladoc.git
   cd paelladoc
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Using GENERATE-DOC

The `GENERATE-DOC` command analyzes a code repository and generates interactive documentation:

```
GENERATE-DOC repo_path=/path/to/repository
```

### Parameters

- `repo_path`: Path to the repository you want to document
- `output`: Path where to save the documentation (optional)
- `template`: Documentation template to use (optional)
- `context_path`: Path to the context directory (optional)

### Examples

```
# Basic documentation
GENERATE-DOC repo_path=~/projects/my-api

# Specifying output path
GENERATE-DOC repo_path=~/projects/my-api output=~/documentation/my-api

# Using a specific template
GENERATE-DOC repo_path=~/projects/my-api template=api-docs
```

## Code Analysis Process

PAELLADOC uses [repopack-py](https://github.com/abinthomasonline/repopack-py) to convert code repositories into text format that can be processed by AI systems. This process:

1. Extracts all source code from the repository
2. Converts it into an optimized text format
3. Analyzes architecture patterns, APIs, and database schemas
4. Generates documentation based on the analysis

## Directory Structure

```
paelladoc/
├── code_context/              # Processed repository content
│   ├── extracted/             # Repositories extracted as text
│   ├── analyzed/              # Analysis results
│   │   ├── architecture/      # Architecture analysis
│   │   ├── api/               # API analysis
│   │   └── database/          # Database analysis
│   └── generated/             # Generated documentation
├── .cursor/rules/             # Cursor rules for AI
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
└── README.md                  # This file
```
