## 🎯 The Art of Documentation in the AI Era

Just as a master chef knows that the secret to a perfect paella lies in the quality of its ingredients and the order of preparation, PAELLADOC builds on a fundamental truth: **90% of success in AI programming depends on context**.

### 🧠 Why Context is Crucial?

- **AI is powerful, but needs direction**: Like an expert chef, it needs to know exactly what we want to achieve
- **Traditional documentation is scattered**: Like ingredients scattered in the kitchen
- **We waste time repeating context**: Like explaining the recipe over and over
- **Without proper context, we get generic answers**: Like a flavorless paella

### 🥘 The PAELLADOC Solution

Following the MECE principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive), we organize documentation with a modular architecture:

```
paelladoc/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── orchestrator/        # Central orchestrator definition
│       │   └── paelladoc.mdc    # Defines all commands and delegates to modules
│       ├── commands/            # Command definitions by category

# PAELLADOC - Intelligent Documentation System

PAELLADOC is a documentation system that uses AI to analyze code repositories and generate comprehensive technical documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Access to terminal/command line
- Cursor 0.47+ (AI-powered IDE)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paelladoc.git
   cd paelladoc
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   
   # On Windows
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Using GENERATE_CONTEXT and GENERATE_DOC

The documentation generation process has two main steps:

1. **Extract repository context**:
   ```
   GENERATE_CONTEXT repo_path=/path/to/repository
   ```

2. **Generate documentation**:
   ```
   GENERATE_DOC repo_path=/path/to/repository language=en
   ```

### Parameters for GENERATE_CONTEXT

- `repo_path`: Path to the repository you want to process (required)
- `output`: Path where to save the extracted content (optional)
- `line_numbers`: Whether to include line numbers (optional)
- `style`: Output format - plain or xml (optional)
- `ignore`: Additional patterns to ignore (optional)

### Parameters for GENERATE_DOC

- `repo_path`: Path or GitHub URL to the repository you want to document (required)
- `language`: Language for documentation output - "en" for English or "es" for Spanish (required)
- `output`: Path where to save the documentation (optional, default: `docs/generated`)
- `context_output_file`: Path for the extracted context file (optional)
- `clone_dir`: Directory for cloning remote repositories (optional)
- `template`: Documentation template to use (optional)
- `force_context_regeneration`: Force regenerate context even if exists (optional)
- `force_clone`: Force re-cloning of remote repository (optional)

### Examples

```
# Extract repository context
GENERATE_CONTEXT repo_path=~/projects/my-api

# Generate documentation in English from local repository
GENERATE_DOC repo_path=~/projects/my-api language=en

# Generate documentation in Spanish from GitHub URL
GENERATE_DOC repo_path=https://github.com/username/repo language=es

# Generate documentation with custom output path
GENERATE_DOC repo_path=~/projects/my-api language=en output=~/custom/docs
```

### Dynamic Template Menu

When you run `GENERATE_DOC`, the system will:

1. Confirm your preferred language (English or Spanish)
2. Clone and analyze the repository (if URL provided)
3. Present a dynamic menu of documentation options based on available templates
4. Generate documentation according to your selections
5. Save files to the output directory with proper naming

This process makes it easy to generate exactly the documentation you need from any repository, local or remote.

## Code Analysis Process

PAELLADOC uses a multi-step process to generate documentation:

1. **Content Extraction**: Extracts all source code from the repository
2. **Context Generation**: Converts code into an optimized text format
3. **Code Analysis**: Analyzes architecture patterns, APIs, and database schemas
4. **Interactive Documentation**: Creates comprehensive documentation with user input
