# ü•ò PAELLADOC

## üéØ The Power of Context in AI Programming
PAELLADOC stems from a fundamental truth: **90% of success in AI programming depends on context**. Just as a good paella requires the precise combination of ingredients and technique, effective AI programming needs rich and well-structured context.

While expensive paid solutions claim to solve this problem, PAELLADOC delivers the same powerful context management **completely free**, directly integrated with your Cursor IDE. No subscriptions, no external services‚Äîjust pure contextual intelligence at your fingertips.

### Why Context is Crucial
- üß† AIs are extremely powerful, but they need clear context
- üìö Traditional documentation is often scattered and poorly structured
- üéØ 90% of time is wasted giving repetitive context to the AI
- üîÑ Without adequate context, we get generic or incorrect answers
- üí∞ Paid solutions charge premium prices for what PAELLADOC offers for free

### The PAELLADOC Solution
Like a well-structured recipe, PAELLADOC organizes documentation following the MECE principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) to provide:
- üìã Complete and structured context
- üéØ Specific and relevant documentation
- ü§ñ AI-optimized format
- üîç Easy access to necessary information
- üíª Direct integration with Cursor‚Äîno external tools required
- üÜì All the power of premium context management solutions at zero cost

### 4. MDC File for Cursor Project Rules

Upon completing the documentation process, PAELLADOC generates an MDC (Cursor Documentation Model) file specific to your project:

- **Location**: `docs/[type]/[project-name]/[project-name].mdc.example`
- **Purpose**: Provide complete context to Cursor AI during development
- **Content**: Configuration adapted to your project's specific documentation

**Structure of the generated MDC**:
```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "name": "PROJECT_NAME-docs",
    "description": "Complete documentation for PROJECT_NAME project",
    "patterns": ["**/*"],
    "rules": [
        {
            "name": "project-overview",
            "description": "Project overview",
            "patterns": ["**/*"],
            "instructions": [
                "# Project: PROJECT_NAME",
                "",
                "## General description",
                "PROJECT_DESCRIPTION",
                "",
                "## Project type",
                "PROJECT_TYPE (Complete product / Feature / Bug Fix / Task)",
                "",
                "## Available documentation",
                "This rule provides access to all project documentation..."
            ]
        },
        // Includes sections for:
        // - Project-specific documentation
        // - Important decisions
        // - Development memory
    ],
    "priorities": [
        {
            "source": "DOCS_PATH",
            "weight": 3.0
        }
    ],
    "project_directives": {
        "name": "PROJECT_NAME-documentation",
        "ai_first": true,
        "documentation_path": "DOCS_PATH",
        "memory_file_path": "MEMORY_FILE_PATH"
    }
}
```

**Real purpose of the MDC**: The MDC file provides Cursor AI with all the context of your project, allowing you to program with an assistant that truly understands:
- The structure and architecture of your product
- Design decisions and their reasons
- Requirements and limitations
- Project rules and conventions

To leverage this context in your development:
1. Copy the generated MDC file to the `.cursor/rules/` folder of your project
2. When programming with Cursor AI, the assistant will have access to all documented context
3. You'll get much more relevant code suggestions and responses aligned with your project
4. The assistant will understand the global vision, not just the current code fragment

This approach eliminates the need to repeatedly explain context, allowing you to focus on solving specific problems with an assistant that already understands your project in depth.

### 5. Development Memory

PAELLADOC includes a powerful development memory functionality that allows you to record progress, problems, and decisions during implementation:

- **Available commands**:
  - `LOGRO [description]`: Records a new achievement or progress in development
  - `PROBLEMA [description]`: Records a problem encountered during development
  - `DECISI√ìN [description]`: Records an important technical decision
  - `MEMORIA`: Shows all stored records

- **Benefits**:
  - **Tracking**: Maintain a chronological record of all progress
  - **Automatic documentation**: Generate technical documentation while developing
  - **Team context**: Makes it easier for other members to understand decisions made
  - **Problem solving**: Record problems and their solutions for future reference

- **Operation**:
  - All information is automatically saved in a `dev_memory.json` file
  - The Cursor AI assistant can access this memory to offer more contextualized responses
  - You can filter memory by type (achievements, problems, decisions)
  - Memory stays synchronized with the project

This functionality turns PAELLADOC not just into an initial documentation tool, but into a continuous assistant throughout the development cycle.

## üöÄ How to Use

### The PAELLA Ritual
The process is simple: write `PAELLA` and the system:
1. Listens to your need (the dish you want to create)
2. Analyzes the necessary context
3. Recommends the best structure
4. Selects the perfect templates
5. Asks for the project name
6. Lets you choose the documentation language
7. Guides you in creating the documentation

### Intelligent Navigation
- Write `PASALA` at any time to skip to the next section
- This allows you to quickly advance through parts that aren't relevant to your case
- You can always go back to complete sections if necessary

### Documentation Types

#### a) Complete Product with Complete Needs
- Market research
- User analysis
- Comprehensive documentation
- Detailed planning

#### b) Complete Product with Specific Needs

## üß† Intelligent Features

### Persistent Memory System
PAELLADOC includes an intelligent memory system that automatically saves your progress:

- **Memory File**: Each project has its own `.memory.json`
- **Saved Content**:
  - All provided information
  - Completed and pending sections
  - Current project phase
  - Selected templates
  - Language preference

- **Benefits**:
  - **Continuity**: Resume exactly where you left off
  - **No losses**: Never lose information already provided
  - **Complete context**: The assistant remembers all previous context
  - **Flexibility**: Work on multiple projects by alternating between them

- **Usage**:
  - When starting PAELLA with an existing project, the system detects the memory file
  - It asks if you want to continue where you left off
  - You can resume work or start over

### Multilingual Support
PAELLADOC allows you to create documentation in different languages:

- Select your preferred language at the beginning of the process
- All templates and questions will automatically adapt
- The generated documentation will be completely in the chosen language
- Your language preference is saved in the memory file

## üõ† Configuration and Resources

### Cursor Requirements
For PAELLADOC to work correctly with Cursor, you need to have **Yolo mode** enabled in the configuration:

![Yolo Mode Activation in Cursor](./assets/images/yolo_mode.png)

This configuration allows the assistant to execute commands and write files automatically, which is essential for the smooth operation of PAELLADOC.

To activate Yolo Mode:
1. Go to Settings in Cursor (‚öôÔ∏è)
2. Navigate to the Features section
3. Enable the "Enable yolo mode" option
4. Make sure the description shows: "Allow agent chat to run tools without asking for confirmation"

No additional special configuration is required. Templates are organized in:
- `.notes/` for complete templates
- `.notes/simplified_templates/` for simplified templates

### Available Templates

#### Complete Templates
1. Market Research
2. User Research
3. Problem Definition
4. Product Definition
5. Roadmap
6. Architecture
7. Technical Specifications
8. And more...

#### Simplified Templates
1. Feature Documentation
2. Bug Documentation
3. Quick Task Documentation
