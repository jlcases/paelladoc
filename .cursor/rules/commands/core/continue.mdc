# CONTINUE Command - Interactive Project Selection and Continuation

THESE INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY AS WRITTEN:

1. For the CONTINUE command, YOU MUST ASK JUST ONE QUESTION AT A TIME.
2. After asking ONE question, STOP and WAIT for the user's response.
3. ONLY AFTER receiving the user's answer to that specific question should you proceed to the next question.
4. NEVER combine multiple questions into a single message.
5. Follow the strict sequence below.

## Interactive Project Selection Sequence

When the CONTINUE command is invoked, follow this exact sequence:

1. Display a brief welcome message explaining that this command allows continuing work on existing projects.

2. SCAN the directory "/Users/jlcases/codigo/paelladoc/docs/" to find all project folders.
   - Look for directories that contain a memory.json file
   - Extract project information from each memory.json

3. IF NO PROJECTS ARE FOUND:
   - Display: "No projects found to continue. Use the PAELLA command to create a new project."
   - END the command execution
   - DO NOT ask any further questions

4. IF PROJECTS ARE FOUND, DISPLAY a numbered list of all available projects in this format:
   ```
   Available projects:
   1. [project_name_1] - [project_type] - Last updated: [date]
   2. [project_name_2] - [project_type] - Last updated: [date]
   ...
   ```

5. Ask ONLY: "Which project would you like to continue working on? (Enter the number or name)"
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   
6. AFTER the user selects a project:
   - LOAD the memory.json file from the selected project
   - DISPLAY a summary of the project details (name, type, methodologies, etc.)
   
7. Ask ONLY: "Would you like to update Cursor rules from the documentation? (yes/no)"
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   - Default is "yes" if user is unsure
   
8. Ask ONLY: "Would you like to synchronize templates with the current state? (yes/no)"
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   - Default is "yes" if user is unsure
   
9. Show a summary of all selections and ask for confirmation to proceed.
   - AFTER user confirmation, load the project and continue with documentation

## Project Memory Management

When continuing work on a selected project:

1. READ the memory.json file from "/Users/jlcases/codigo/paelladoc/docs/[project_name]/memory.json"
2. EXTRACT all stored parameters, decisions, and settings
3. Use these parameters to initialize the development environment
4. UPDATE the "last_updated" timestamp in the memory.json file
5. DISPLAY project history from the decisions, achievements, and issues arrays

## Memory File Loading

The memory.json file should be loaded and parsed with this structure:
```json
{
  "project_name": "name_of_project",
  "language": "language_used",
  "project_type": "type_of_project",
  "methodologies": ["methodologies_used"],
  "git_workflow": "workflow_used",
  "generate_rules": true/false,
  "ai_mode": "mode_used",
  "create_project_subfolder": true/false,
  "timestamp": "creation_timestamp",
  "last_updated": "last_update_timestamp",
  "decisions": [],
  "achievements": [],
  "issues": []
}
```

## Project Directory Scanning

When scanning for available projects:
1. CHECK for directories in "/Users/jlcases/codigo/paelladoc/docs/"
2. For each directory, look for a "memory.json" file
3. If memory.json exists, read it to extract project details
4. ONLY include directories that have a valid memory.json file
5. SORT projects by last_updated timestamp (most recent first)

## Parameter Definitions

```yaml
args:
  - name: "project_name"
    type: "string"
    description: "Name of the project to continue with"
    required: true
  - name: "update_rules"
    type: "boolean"
    description: "Whether to update Cursor rules from documentation"
    default: true
  - name: "sync_templates"
    type: "boolean"
    description: "Whether to synchronize templates with current state"
    default: true
```
