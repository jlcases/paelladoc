# PAELLA Command - Interactive Project Documentation Initializer

THESE INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY AS WRITTEN:

1. For the PAELLA command, YOU MUST ASK JUST ONE QUESTION AT A TIME.
2. After asking ONE question, STOP and WAIT for the user's response.
3. ONLY AFTER receiving the user's answer to that specific question should you proceed to the next question.
4. NEVER combine multiple questions into a single message.
5. Follow the strict sequence below.

## Interactive Questionnaire Sequence

When the PAELLA command is invoked, follow this exact sequence:

1. Display a brief welcome message
2. Ask ONLY: "What language would you prefer for the documentation? (es/en)"
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   
3. Ask ONLY: "What is the name of your project?"
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   - IMMEDIATELY after getting the project name, create a project folder at "/Users/jlcases/codigo/paelladoc/docs/{project_name}"
   
4. Ask ONLY: "What type of project is it? Options are: frontend, backend, chrome_extension, fullstack, or mobile_app."
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   - STORE this decision in memory
   
5. Ask ONLY: "Which development methodologies would you like to apply? Options are: tdd, github_workflow, or both."
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   - STORE this decision in memory
   
6. Ask ONLY: "Which Git workflow style do you want to use? Options are: github_flow, gitflow, trunk_based, or no_workflow."
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   - STORE this decision in memory
   
7. Ask ONLY: "Would you like to generate Cursor rules from the documentation? (yes/no)"
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   - STORE this decision in memory
   
8. Ask ONLY: "What AI operation mode do you prefer? Options are: autonomous, collaborative, or advisory."
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   - STORE this decision in memory
   
9. Ask ONLY: "Should I create a project subfolder in the docs directory? (yes/no)"
   - WAIT for response before continuing
   - STORE this decision in memory
   
10. Show a summary of all selections and ask for confirmation to proceed.
    - AFTER user confirmation, SAVE all decisions to "/Users/jlcases/codigo/paelladoc/docs/{project_name}/memory.json"

## Project Memory Management

AFTER collecting all parameters and receiving user confirmation:

1. CREATE the project folder at "/Users/jlcases/codigo/paelladoc/docs/{project_name}" if it doesn't exist
2. SAVE all collected parameters and decisions to a memory.json file:
   - Path: "/Users/jlcases/codigo/paelladoc/docs/{project_name}/memory.json"
   - Format: JSON object with all parameters as keys
   - Include: timestamp, all user decisions, parameters, and settings
3. This memory.json file will be used to:
   - Avoid asking the same questions again in future sessions
   - Maintain consistency across documentation
   - Store project history and decision record
   - Enable the CONTINUE command to resume work on this project

## Memory File Structure

The memory.json file should include:
```json
{
  "project_name": "name_provided_by_user",
  "language": "selected_language",
  "project_type": "selected_type",
  "methodologies": ["selected_methodologies"],
  "git_workflow": "selected_workflow",
  "generate_rules": true/false,
  "ai_mode": "selected_mode",
  "create_project_subfolder": true/false,
  "timestamp": "creation_timestamp",
  "last_updated": "last_update_timestamp",
  "decisions": [],
  "achievements": [],
  "issues": []
}
```
