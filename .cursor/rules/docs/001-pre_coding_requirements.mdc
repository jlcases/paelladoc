# Pre-Coding Requirements

Before starting any code implementation in PaellaPACK/PaellaDOC, it is mandatory to define and document the following aspects:

## Git Workflow

The following must be clearly documented:

- Which Git workflow will be used (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-based, etc.)
- Branch naming conventions
- Commit policy (format, granularity)
- Pull request and review policy
- Merge vs rebase strategy

## Development Methodology

The following must be specified:

- Whether TDD (Test-Driven Development) will be used
- Test structure and minimum required coverage
- Specific testing tools
- Continuous integration process

## Repository Hosting

The following must be defined:

- Where the repository will be hosted (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
- Permission and access structure
- Branch protection configuration
- Integration with CI/CD tools

## Authorization Process

Any code implementation must have explicit authorization after documenting the above aspects. Use the command:

```
AUTHORIZE_CODE git_flow=<flow> tdd=<yes|no> repo=<repository_host>
```

Example:
```
AUTHORIZE_CODE git_flow=github_flow tdd=yes repo=github
```

This requirement is linked to the general authorization rules of PaellaDOC:
