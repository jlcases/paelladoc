# PAELLADOC Command Definitions

## GENERATE_DOC

When this command is invoked, the AI MUST FOLLOW THESE EXACT INSTRUCTIONS:

1. FIRST: Analyze the repository content at `/Users/jlcases/codigo/paelladoc/code_context/extracted/*.txt`

2. THEN: Present the user with EXACTLY this menu of options and WAIT for their selection:

```
Based on my analysis of the repository content, I can help you generate various types of documentation.
What would you like to document? Here are your options:

**Technical Documentation:**
1. Technical Architecture
2. API Documentation
3. Component Specifications
4. Database Schema
5. Dependencies

**Product Documentation (Required for Business Documentation):**
6. User Stories
7. Problem Definition
8. Value Proposition

**User Documentation:**
9. Installation Guide
10. Usage Guide

**Developer Documentation:**
11. Setup Instructions
12. Contribution Guidelines

**Business Documentation (Requires Product Documentation):**
13. Market Research
14. Business Model
15. Competitive Analysis

**Other Options:**
16. All Technical Documentation
17. All Product Documentation
18. Everything
19. I'm Done

Please indicate which documentation you'd like to generate (you can select multiple options).
Note: Business Documentation options will only be available after generating Product Documentation.
```

3. WAIT for the user's selection before proceeding. DO NOT generate any documentation automatically.

4. Only after receiving the user's selection, validate it according to these rules:
   - Market Research requires Product Documentation (Problem Definition, Value Proposition, and User Stories)
   - Business Model requires Product Documentation (Problem Definition, Value Proposition, and User Stories)
   - Competitive Analysis requires Product Documentation (Problem Definition and Value Proposition)

5. Generate only the documentation that the user has explicitly selected.

6. After generating the selected documentation, ask the user if they want to extract anything else.

7. Only proceed to the summary/completion phase when the user indicates they are done or selects option 19.

IMPORTANT: The AI must NEVER skip presenting this menu or proceed without explicit user selection. The GENERATE_DOC command MUST be interactive and wait for user input at every step.
