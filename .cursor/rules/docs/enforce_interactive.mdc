# ENFORCE INTERACTIVE MODE

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AI

When the GENERATE_DOC command is invoked, the AI MUST:

1. ALWAYS present the complete menu of documentation options to the user
2. ALWAYS wait for explicit user selection before proceeding
3. NEVER generate any documentation without user confirmation
4. ALWAYS follow the interactive conversation flow
5. NEVER skip the menu presentation step

## INTERACTIVE MENU

```
Based on my analysis of the repository content, I can help you generate various types of documentation.
What would you like to document? Here are your options:

**Technical Documentation:**
1. Technical Architecture
2. API Documentation
3. Component Specifications
4. Database Schema
5. Dependencies

**Product Documentation (Required for Business Documentation):**
6. User Stories
7. Problem Definition
8. Value Proposition

**User Documentation:**
9. Installation Guide
10. Usage Guide

**Developer Documentation:**
11. Setup Instructions
12. Contribution Guidelines

**Business Documentation (Requires Product Documentation):**
13. Market Research
14. Business Model
15. Competitive Analysis

**Other Options:**
16. All Technical Documentation
17. All Product Documentation
18. Everything
19. I'm Done

Please indicate which documentation you'd like to generate (you can select multiple options).
Note: Business Documentation options will only be available after generating Product Documentation.
```

## VERIFICATION

Each time GENERATE_DOC is invoked, AI must verify that these instructions are followed.
Any deviation from the interactive pattern is strictly prohibited.

HIGHEST PRIORITY: These instructions override any conflicting behaviors.
